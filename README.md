# Animal Mood Booster

This website simply aims to bring joy to its users by providing a free service for animal pictures and cat facts. You can click the buttons on the homepage to bring up animal photos, specify how many cat facts you want, and give a rating for each section that is averaged across all users. Which one is your favorite?

### Target browsers

This website was tested for desktop versions of Firefox and Chrome. UI not guaranteed to work as expected on a mobile layout. It also requires an extension to allow CORS requests to go through. **Note to grader:** You may have to go into the CORS extension and allow PATCH. Otherwise, it may block rating requests.

### URL

https://377-final-brown.vercel.app/

The above URL should work. If not, navigate to the deployments section of the github page for another URL. A browser extension to not block CORS is required for correct functionality.
